# Crush Closet â€” Starter Site

A clean, responsive starter for a curated fashion blog that ships weekly edits called **Crushes of the Week**, filtered by **season**, **occasion**, and **budget**.

## Quick Start
1. Edit content in `content/picks.json` (add more items).
2. Open `index.html` locally, or deploy to Netlify / GitHub Pages.
3. Replace newsletter form with your provider (Buttondown, Mailchimp, Substack, Beehiiv, etc.).

## Deploy (Netlify)
- Drag this folder into Netlify; no build step needed.
- Netlify Forms will capture emails from the `<form>` as-is (check the Forms tab).

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
- Create a repo, push files, enable Pages for the `main` branch.
- Access site at `https://<you>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Customize
- Change brand name in `index.html` (title + header + footer).
- Color & font tweaks in `styles.css` variables.
- Dark/light mode toggles automatically and via header button.
- Add analytics (Plausible/GA4) by inserting your script in `index.html`.
